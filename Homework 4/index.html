  <h1>To Investigate or Not</h1>
 <div id = "story">
  <br>
  Spring cleaning. The time to throw open the windows and get the dust out of the house. For Liz
  this means entering the attic and going through another box of her family's things. These boxes
  were given to her when the last of her family passed away and every year she opens one box. Each
  box is labeled with the name of the family member it belonged to. However, while moving the
  remaining boxes in a way that won't completely block off access to most of the attic, she finds a 
  box that isn't labeled. After opening it she finds pictures from the early 1900s with her Grandparents and their friends.
  Some of the pictures are labeled with the names of the people in the photos. At the bottom of
  the box is her Grandparents' journal detailing the adventures they went on.
  <br>
  Should she investigate the journal and notebooks?
